This second course teaches you advanced techniques to improve the computer vision model you built in Course 1. You will explore how to work with real-world images in different shapes and sizes, visualize the journey of an image through convolutions to understand how a computer “sees” information, plot loss and accuracy, and explore strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropouts. Finally, Course 2 will introduce you to transfer learning and how learned features can be extracted from models.
